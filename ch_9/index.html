    <h2 class="PIAIC">PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE <br> AND COMPUTING</h2>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-<br>
        for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and<br>
        Zia Khan to help promote education, research and bussiness opportunities in emerging tech <br>
        fields like
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="">Cloud Native Computing</a></li><br>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li><br>
        <li>Blockchain</li><br>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>C</b>loud Native computing:</h2>
    <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source<br>
    technologies like, <i><b>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</b></i><br>
    while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development.<br>
    techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
</p>
    <h2><b>A</b>rtificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>The <b>artificial intelligence</b> progra, of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI <br>
    technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <i><b>Python, Numpy, Pandas, <br>
    Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</b></i> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and <br>
    ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h2><b>B</b>lockchain:</h2>
    <p>The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <i><b>Ethereum <br>
    and Hyperledger (Fabric),</b></i> and learn to program in languages such as Solodity, JavaScript on <br>
    framworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps <br>
    (DApps), framworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-<br>
    services (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h2><b>I</b>nternet of Things:</h2>
    <p>The <b>Internat of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development <br>
    technologies like <i><b>Rust, Emdedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, <br>
    and Kubernetes</b></i> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT <br>
    Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
